<h2>Java Swing</h2>

<p>Java Swing library provides a set of classes for developing applications with GUI. </p>

<h4>Step 1: Swing Tutorial</h4>

<p>A simple tutorial to learn Swing basics is given in <a href="13_2_Java_Swing_tutorial.pdf">Java Swing Tutorial.</a> As a first step read this tutorial and try the programs to get familiar with writing Swing programs. This tutorial is created by Sudheer (dovari.sudheerkiran@gmail.com). All credits to him for this wonderful tutorial.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Understand the Calculator application</h4>

<p>Once you are decently comfortable (you don't have to become an expert really, you become an expert only over a period of time), try to get a hang of the the calculator program <a href="13_3_ScientificCalculator.java">13_3_ScientificCalculator.java</a>. Try to tweak the program by adding one or two buttons, changing few labels, changing the size, etc.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Transform the Calculator application</h4>

<p>Once you get the hang, start transforming the calculator program to perform computations with fractions instead of integer numbers. i.e. Once you press 3/11,  press "multiply" button, press 1/4 and finally press "=". This should display 3/44. Change the button labels +, -, * and / to Add, Sub, Mul and Div and include a new button for / to avoid clash with Div and /.</p> 

<h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>

<p>GOLDEN RULE TO REMEMBER AND PRACTICE: Do one change at a time (however trivial it might be), make sure the program compiles, runs and ensure the intended change is working correctly as you transform the calculator application for handling fractions.<p>

<p>Seek help when you are stuck. The best way to help yourself is to refer to the books or websites and fix it yourself. This way you increase your knowledge and become more confident and independent. If it takes too long or you are clueless seek instructor's help.</p>

<p>Don't try something - be it syntax or a language feature - that you don't understand in the first place. This doesn't help and has a negative effect. First understand at least a bit before trying.</p>

<p>Don't rely only on the lab hours alone. You will surely not enough of them to do all this. It is expected that you need spend more time outside the class hours in order to implement the Calculator program for fractions. Use the September holidays to do this.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT: You should submit the completed Calculator application for Fractions by September 30th in AUMS.</b></p>
