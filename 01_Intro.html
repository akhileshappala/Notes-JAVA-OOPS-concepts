<h1>&shy;Object Oriented Programming Intro</h1>
<h3 class="western">Four kinds of programming paradigms 
</h3>
<pre class="western"> (1)  <b>Imperative:</b> First do this, then do that (Algol, C, Pascal)

 (2)  <b>Functional:</b> Declarative, originates from mathematical discipline (Scheme, Lisp, Scala)

 (3)  <b>Logic:</b> Based on axioms, inference rules and queries (Prolog)

 (4)  <b>Object oriented:</b> Supports encapsulation and logical grouping of program aspects (SmallTalk, Eiffel, Java, C++)
</pre><h3 class="western">
OO programming = OO thinking + programming</h3>
<pre class="western">There is literally nothing an OO program can do which an imperative program cannot. Just a way of thinking and organizing.

Centered around the concept of &quot;objects&quot; that may contain data referred to as &quot;fields&quot; or &quot;attributes&quot;

And code in the form of procedures also called as &quot;methods&quot;

An object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated

Features include encapsulation, data hiding, composition, inheritance,  delegation, polymorphism, dynamic dispatch

Helps in better comprehensibility, safety, reusability, extensibility and maintainability</pre><h3 class="western">
Java 
</h3>
<pre class="western"><span style="background: #ffff00">A general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented</span> 

Specifically designed to have as few dependencies as possible. Write once, run anywhere (WORA).

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. 

Originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) 

The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

The latest version is Java 8

Java's main strength:  <b>Libraries </b> -- that spans length and breadth of technologies: 
 - core programming, GUI development, event driven programming, 
 - networking, web development, enterprise development, big data, 
 - concurrency, parallel and distributed programming, big data,
 - embedded, mobile, ...... the list never ends </pre><h3 class="western">
Writing Java Programs 
</h3>
<pre class="western"> You can use any editor: vi, emacs, textedit, notepad

 Saved with <b>.java</b> extension

 <b>javac Hello.java</b> at command prompt/terminal for compilation

 <b>java Hello</b> at command prompt/terminal for execution</pre><h3 class="western">
An Example: Sigma.java 
</h3>
<pre class="western">/* Aum Amma */

public class Sigma {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Sigma f = new Sigma();
    int sum = f.findSum(10);
    System.out.println(&quot;sum = &quot; + sum);
  }

  public int findSum(int num) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i=1; i&lt;=num; i++)
        sum += num;
    return sum;
  }
}

cmd&gt; javac Sigma.java    =&gt; Creates Sigma.class
cmd&gt; java Sigma
sum = 55
cmd&gt;

Please note: File name should be same as the class name.</pre><h3 class="western">
