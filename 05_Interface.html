<h2 class="western">Interface</h2>
<p><span style="background: #ffff00">An interface in Java is an
abstract type that is used to specify a behaviour that classes must
implement.</span> They are similar to protocols. Implementing an
interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it
promises to provide. Interfaces form a contract between the class and
the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the
compiler. If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods
defined by that interface must appear in its source code before the
class will successfully compile.</p>
<p>Interfaces are used to encode similarities which the classes of
various types share, but do not necessarily constitute a class
relationship. For instance, a triangle and a circle covers an area;
however, the way you compute their area are pretty different. There
is no parent-child or container-contained relationship between them.
i.e. one is not the extension of the other nor contained within the
other. However, they both are related in that they have to implement
'area' method. Interface is used to capture the relationship between
them. In such a case, you define an interface &quot;Shape&quot; and
both Triangle and Circle implement the Shape interface.</p>
<h3 class="western">Defining Interface</h3>
<pre class="western">- We define an interface for Shape, very similar to class but no implementation

--------------Shape.java----------------
  public interface Shape {

    public static final double pi = 3.14; 
    
    public double area();
    public double perimeter();
  }
-----------------------------------------------

- A number of points to note

  1. An interface needs to be defined in a file with the same name (like class).
  2. Only the method signature is specified and not its body.
  3.<span style="background: #ffff00"> An interface cannot be instantiated like a class. For example,</span>
<span style="background: #ffff00">     Shape s = new Shape(); is not possible</span>
<span style="background: #ffff00">  4. There are no constructors for an interface, since it cannot be instantiated.</span>
  5.<span style="background: #ffff00"> You can't define instance attributes for the same reason</span>.
  6. You can define only &quot;static final&quot; attributes.

- &quot;public static final double pi&quot;
     final -&gt; pi value cannot be changed during its lifetime
     static -&gt; pi value does not vary with objects of type Triangle, Circle, etc
     public -&gt; pi can be accessed directly by &quot;Shape.pi&quot; 
               We make it public since it is a kind of global constant

<span style="background: #ffff00">- Note that it doesn't make sense to declare methods for getters or setters in an interface,</span>
<span style="background: #ffff00">  since no object attributes are defined. i.e. only 'static final' attributes are defined </span>
  in an interface for which values have to be set right there.

  Recall: Non-static attribute belongs to an object instance, static attributes belong
  to the class, final attribute cannot be modified.
  
- Nor does it make sense to define constructors since an interface can never be instantiated.</pre><h3 class="western">
Implementing an Interface</h3>
<pre class="western">- Typically, a class implements an interface.

- Now Circle and Triangle classes can be implemented as follows.

- Note: You will be forced to implement both the area() and perimeter() methods
  Try not implementing at least one of them and check out the what happens.

  public class Circle implements Shape {
      protected double radius;

     // @override
     public double area() {
          return pi * radius * radius;
     }

     // @override
     public double perimeter() {
          // Your code
     }
}

- You should always annotate methods with @Override. It allows the Java compiler 
  to catch errors where you think you are overriding (or implementing) a method, 
  but are actually defining a new method (different signature). 

- Note: @override is commented. Either // @override or /* @override */

- In a similar fashion define classes for Triangle, Square and Rectangle.

- Write driver classes to invoke, work out and understand.</pre><h3 class="western">
Extending Interface to an Interface</h3>
<pre class="western">- You can extend an interface to make a bigger interface. For example, if X is an interface,
  interface Y can be extended from X as follows. 

  public interface X {

      public void a();
      public void b();
  }

  public interface Y extends X {

      public void c();
  }

- Now any class that implements Y must necessarily implement a(), b() and c().

- But a class that implements X needs to implement only a() and b().</pre><h3 class="western">
Extending class to an Interface</h3>
<pre class="western">- You can also extend a class to a make an interface. For example, if P is a class,
  interface Q can be extended from P as follows.

  public class P {
     protected int x;
     
     public int getX() { return x; }
     public void setX(int val) { x = val; }
  }

  publc interface Q extends P {
     public void someMethod()
  }

- Now any class that implements Q must implement someMethod().

- P can be independently instantiated or extended since it is a class.</pre><h3 class="western">
Implementing Multiple Interfaces</h3>
<pre class="western"><span style="background: #ffff00">- You can implement multiple interfaces simultaneously unlike extending multiple classes</span>.

- Lets say you have two intefaces X and Y.

  public interface X {
       public void a();
       public void b();
  }

  public interface Y {
       public void c();
       public void d();
  }

- You can do the following.

  public class Z implements X, Y {
       public void a() { // code here };
       public void b() { // code here };
       public void c() { // code here };
       public void d() { // code here };      
  }

- You have to implement all the methods that belong to both these interfaces.</pre><h3 class="western">
Abstract Classes</h3>
<pre class="western">- <span style="background: #ffff00">Abstract class falls between a class and interface. </span>

-<span style="background: #ffff00"> They may have some but not all methods implemented. Non-implemented methods should be</span>
<span style="background: #ffff00">  specified using 'abstract' keyword.</span>

- Since they are not fully implemented, they can't be instantiated. However,<span style="background: #ffff00"> with </span>
<span style="background: #ffff00">  abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define </span>
<span style="background: #ffff00">  public, protected, and private concrete methods.</span>

- Any class extending an abstract class must implement the non-implemented methods.

- An example below:
    public abstract class A {
        public void a() {          // is implemented
           // body of the method
        }

        public abstract void b();  // not implemented
    }

- You can extend only one class, whether or not it is abstract, whereas you can 
  implement any number of interfaces.

- Consider using abstract classes if any of these statements apply to your situation:

  --- You want to share code among several closely related classes.
  --- You expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or 
  --- fields, or require access modifiers other than public (such as protected and private).
  --- You want to declare non-static or non-final fields. This enables you to define methods 
      that can access and modify the state of the object to which they belong.

- We noted that a class that implements an interface must implement all of the interface's methods. 

- It is possible, however, to define a class that does not implement all of the interface's methods, 
  provided that the class is declared to be abstract. For example,

abstract class X implements Y {
  // implements all but one method of Y
}

class XX extends X {
  // implements the remaining method in Y
}

In this case, class X must be abstract because it does not fully implement Y, but class XX does, in fact, implement Y.
