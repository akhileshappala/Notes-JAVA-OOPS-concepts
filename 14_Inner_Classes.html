<h1>Java Inner Classes</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss inner classes of Java.</p>
<h2 class="western">Nested Classes</h2>
<p>In Java, just like methods, variables of a class too can have
another class as its member. <span style="background: #ffff00">Writing
a class within another is allowed in Java. The class written within
is called the </span><b><span style="background: #ffff00">nested
class</span></b><span style="background: #ffff00">, and the class
that holds the inner class is called the </span><b><span style="background: #ffff00">outer
class</span></b><span style="background: #ffff00">.</span></p>
<p><b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>Following is the syntax to write a nested class. Here, the class
<b>Outer_Demo</b> is the outer class and the class <b>Inner_Demo</b>
is the nested class.</p>
<pre class="western">class Outer_Demo {
   class Nested_Demo {
   }
}</pre><p>
Nested classes are divided into two types −</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p><b>Non-static nested classes</b> − These are the
	non-static members of a class.</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>Static nested classes</b> − These are the static
	members of a class.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<h2 class="western">Inner Classes (Non-static Nested Classes)</h2>
<p><span style="background: #ffff00">Inner classes are a security
mechanism in Java. We know a class cannot be associated with the
access modifier <b>private</b>, but if we have the class as a member
of other class, then the inner class can be made private. And this is
also used to access the private members of a class.</span></p>
<p>Inner classes are of three types depending on how and where you
define them. They are −</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Inner Class 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Method-local Inner Class 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>Anonymous Inner Class 
	</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">Inner Class</h3>
<p>Creating an inner class is quite simple. You just need to write a
class within a class. Unlike a class, an inner class can be private
and once you declare an inner class private, it cannot be accessed
from an object outside the class.</p>
<p>Following is the program to create an inner class and access it.
In the given example, we make the inner class private and access the
class through a method.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="western">class Outer_Demo {
   int num;
   
   // inner class
   private class Inner_Demo {
      public void print() {
         System.out.println(&quot;This is an inner class&quot;);
      }
   }
   
   // Accessing he inner class from the method within
   void display_Inner() {
      Inner_Demo inner = new Inner_Demo();
      inner.print();
   }
}
   
public class My_class {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      // Instantiating the outer class 
      Outer_Demo outer = new Outer_Demo();
      
      // Accessing the display_Inner() method.
      outer.display_Inner();
   }
}</pre><p>
Here you can observe that <b>Outer_Demo</b> is the outer class,
<b>Inner_Demo</b> is the inner class, <b><span style="background: #ffff00">display_Inner()</span></b><span style="background: #ffff00">
is the method inside which we are instantiating the inner class, and
this method is invoked from the </span><b><span style="background: #ffff00">main</span></b><span style="background: #ffff00">
method.</span></p>
<p>If you compile and execute the above program, you will get the
following result −</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">This is an inner class.</pre><h3 class="western">
Accessing the Private Members</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, inner classes are also used to access the
private members of a class. Suppose, a class is having private
members to access them. Write an inner class in it, return the
private members from a method within the inner class, say,
<b>getValue()</b>, and finally from another class (from which you
want to access the private members) call the getValue() method of the
inner class.</p>
<p>To instantiate the inner class, initially you have to instantiate
the outer class. Thereafter, using the object of the outer class,
following is the way in which you can instantiate the inner class.</p>
<pre class="western">Outer_Demo outer = new Outer_Demo();
Outer_Demo.Inner_Demo inner = outer.new Inner_Demo();</pre><p>
The following program shows how to access the private members of a
class using inner class.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="western">class Outer_Demo {
   // private variable of the outer class
   private int num = 175;  
   
   // inner class
   public class Inner_Demo {
      public int getNum() {
         System.out.println(&quot;This is the getnum method of the inner class&quot;);
         return num;
      }
   }
}

public class My_class2 {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      // Instantiating the outer class
      Outer_Demo outer = new Outer_Demo();
      
      // Instantiating the inner class
      Outer_Demo.Inner_Demo inner = outer.new Inner_Demo();
      System.out.println(inner.getNum());
   }
}</pre><p>
If you compile and execute the above program, you will get the
following result −</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">The value of num in the class Test is: 175</pre><h2 class="western">
Method-local Inner Class</h2>
<p>In Java, we can write a class within a method and this will be a
local type. Like local variables, the scope of the inner class is
restricted within the method.</p>
<p>A method-local inner class can be instantiated only within the
method where the inner class is defined. The following program shows
how to use a method-local inner class.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="western">public class Outerclass {
   // instance method of the outer class 
   void my_Method() {
      int num = 23;

      // method-local inner class
      class MethodInner_Demo {
         public void print() {
            System.out.println(&quot;This is method inner class &quot;+num);         
         }   
      } // end of inner class
           
      // Accessing the inner class
      MethodInner_Demo inner = new MethodInner_Demo();
      inner.print();
   }
   
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Outerclass outer = new Outerclass();
      outer.my_Method();                   
   }
}</pre><p>
If you compile and execute the above program, you will get the
following result −</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">This is method inner class 23</pre><h2 class="western">
Anonymous Inner Class</h2>
<p><span style="background: #ffff00">An inner class declared without
a class name is known as an </span><b><span style="background: #ffff00">anonymous
inner class</span></b><span style="background: #ffff00">.</span> In
case of anonymous inner classes, we declare and instantiate them at
the same time. Generally, they are used whenever you need to override
the method of a class or an interface. The syntax of an anonymous
inner class is as follows −</p>
<p><b>Syntax</b></p>
<pre class="western">AnonymousInner an_inner = new AnonymousInner() {
   public void my_method() {
      ........
      ........
   }   
};</pre><p>
The following program shows how to override the method of a class
using anonymous inner class.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="western"><span style="background: #ffff00">abstract class AnonymousInner {</span>
  <span style="background: #ffff00"> public abstract void mymethod();</span>
}

public class Outer_class {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      AnonymousInner inner = new AnonymousInner() {
         public void mymethod() {
            System.out.println(&quot;This is an example of anonymous inner class&quot;);
         }
      };
      inner.mymethod(); 
   }
}</pre><p>
If you compile and execute the above program, you will get the
following result −</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">This is an example of anonymous inner class</pre><p>
In the same way, you can override the methods of the concrete class
as well as the interface using an anonymous inner class.</p>
<h2 class="western">Anonymous Inner Class as Argument</h2>
<p>Generally, if a method accepts an object of an interface, an
abstract class, or a concrete class, then we can implement the
interface, extend the abstract class, and pass the object to the
method. If it is a class, then we can directly pass it to the method.</p>
<p>But in all the three cases, you can pass an anonymous inner class
to the method. Here is the syntax of passing an anonymous inner class
as a method argument −</p>
<pre class="western">obj.my_Method(new My_Class() {
   public void Do() {
      .....
      .....
   }
});</pre><p>
The following program shows how to pass an anonymous inner class as a
method argument.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="western">// interface
interface Message {
   String greet();
}

public class My_class {
   // method which accepts the object of interface Message
   public void displayMessage(Message m) {
      System.out.println(m.greet() +
         &quot;, This is an example of anonymous inner class as an argument&quot;);  
   }

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      // Instantiating the class
      My_class obj = new My_class();

      // Passing an anonymous inner class as an argument
      obj.displayMessage(new Message() {
         public String greet() {
            return &quot;Hello&quot;;
         }
      });
   }
}</pre><p>
If you compile and execute the above program, it gives you the
following result −</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Hello This is an example of anonymous inner class as an argument</pre><h2 class="western">
Static Nested Class</h2>
<p>A static inner class is a nested class which is a static member of
the outer class. It can be accessed without instantiating the outer
class, using other static members. Just like static members, a static
nested class does not have access to the instance variables and
methods of the outer class. The syntax of static nested class is as
follows −</p>
<p><b>Syntax</b></p>
<pre class="western">class MyOuter {
   static class Nested_Demo {
   }
}</pre><p>
Instantiating a static nested class is a bit different from
instantiating an inner class. The following program shows how to use
a static nested class.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="western">public class Outer {
   static class Nested_Demo {
      public void my_method() {
         System.out.println(&quot;This is my nested class&quot;);
      }
   }
   
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Outer.Nested_Demo nested = new Outer.Nested_Demo();        
      nested.my_method();
   }
}</pre><p>
If you compile and execute the above program, you will get the
following result −</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">This is my nested class</pre>
